      "what_is": "What is tuberculosis?",
      "what_is_content": "Tuberculosis is a disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which, after a latent phase, becomes active. This active form of the disease corresponds to a multiplication of the bacterium. It is accompanied by symptoms and requires prolonged treatment with specific antibiotics.\n\nIt most often affects the lungs, in which case it is called pulmonary tuberculosis. The disease is contagious only when the lungs are affected. It can also affect other parts of the body, such as lymph nodes, kidneys, brain, bones, etc. In these cases, the disease is not contagious. It can sometimes affect several organs.\n\nBut this disease can be avoided, and it can be cured if treated correctly.",
      "transmission": "How is tuberculosis transmitted?",
      "transmission_content": "Tuberculosis is transmitted through the air by a person whose lungs are affected when they cough, sneeze, or talk. Transmission requires prolonged and close contact with a person who has contagious pulmonary tuberculosis, for example when living in the same household as the contagious person or traveling together in a vehicle.\n\nWhen tuberculosis affects parts of the body other than the lungs, it is not contagious.\n\nNot all people in contact with a case of tuberculosis will necessarily be infected, let alone become ill.\n\nPulmonary tuberculosis is less contagious than diseases like the flu or measles.",
      "how_occurs": "How does tuberculosis occur?",
      "how_occurs_content": "Tuberculosis occurs when the tuberculosis bacteria 'wake up' in the body.\n\nIndeed, when a person breathes in the bacteria, they remain dormant in the body, without causing disease. They remain in a state of rest, inactive, dormant. This is called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The infected person, carrier of a latent tuberculosis infection, is not sick. They show no symptoms and are not contagious.\n\nThe bacteria can remain in the body for the entire life of the infected person without doing anything, as their immune system can contain the infection.\n\nBut for 1 in 10 infected people, the bacteria 'wake up' after the latent phase and become active by multiplying. The person then becomes ill.\n\nThe awakening most often occurs within two years of transmission or when there is immunosuppression related to a disease (such as AIDS), certain immunosuppressive drugs, a state of malnutrition, or age (the elderly and very young children have a weak immune system).\n\nIn the absence of any clinical and radiological signs, the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection can be made using immunological tests such as the tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA)."

But in all cases, the disease can cause the following signs: fever, intense night sweats, great fatigue, and loss of appetite and weight.\n\nIn the case of pulmonary tuberculosis, there is a cough.\n\nThe persistence of these signs for several weeks should suggest tuberculosis and should prompt a visit to the doctor.",

In practice, they should be taken once a day, all at once, at least half an hour before eating. You can also wait 2 hours after a meal to take them.\n\nTreatment is accompanied by regular monitoring such as blood tests.\n\nAt the start of treatment, started in the hospital, the person with contagious pulmonary tuberculosis is isolated (single room, mask, etc.) to avoid infecting others.\n\nIt is very important not to stop treatment, otherwise the disease may return, and to avoid the development of drug resistance, which would then be ineffective.\n\nSocial security covers 100% of the treatment.",

It protects against severe forms of tuberculosis, particularly tuberculous meningitis.\n\nCLATs play a central role in the prevention of tuberculosis. When a case of contagious tuberculosis is diagnosed, the CLAT, informed by the health authorities, conducts an investigation to find people who have been in close contact with the patient. These people can then benefit from screening, including a medical consultation, chest X-ray, and immunological test (such as the tuberculin test or IGRA).\n\nIn the event of detection of latent tuberculosis infection, the CLAT offers preventive treatment to prevent it from progressing to active tuberculosis.\n\nIn addition, the CLAT also organizes targeted screening in certain more exposed populations, such as people from countries where tuberculosis is common, in order to detect the disease as early as possible.",
